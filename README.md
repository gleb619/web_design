For app server i use tomcat, i was too lazy to deploy it on apache or nginx.<br/>
For start you must create web project(In Eclipse: File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project). After creation just copy from WebContent folders 1, 2, 3 to your WebContent.<br/>
Start appserver with project inside. Go to url http://localhost:8080/{your_project_id}/1<br/>
Click on Logo to see how menu expanded.
